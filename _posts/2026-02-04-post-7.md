This Bash reference manual is brought to you by the U.S. Department of Justice, having been discovered among the Epstein files. It is somehow labeled 'R-rated', so you must confirm that you are over 18 to view it, despite being a very thorough manual ideally suited for complete beginners learning Bash. It remains unclear why it ended up in the Epstein files; perhaps his true struggle was Bash coding, because nothing turns a good man into a villain quite like shell scripting. Let us just hope Tux the penguin has never visited the island.
