HyperPhysics, established in 1998 by Dr. Carl Rod Nave at Georgia State University, is a comprehensive and widely used online resource for physics and astrophysics, presenting bite-sized concepts across subfields such as thermodynamics, optics, particle physics and astrophysics in a linked format that allows users to explore interconnected ideas. The content, organised in a flashcard-like style with clear illustrations and well-annotated equations, is both practical and accessible for high school and university students, as well as non-physicist scientists and engineers seeking a concise understanding of new physical concepts. I find it particularly effective for recreational incremental learning, much like using Duolingo for languages. While the team also initiated HyperMath, which remains under construction, the update status of both projects and their translation efforts is unclear as of 2017. Although the existing content remains reliable and functional, users should exercise caution, as the website is often flagged as 'not secure' by browsers. I advise to contact Georgia State University directly before making any donations through the provided links to avoid potential scams.
