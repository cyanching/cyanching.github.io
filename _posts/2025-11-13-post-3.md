Attached, you will find the timeless textbook A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics: Understanding Why and How (Dekking, Kraaikamp, Lopuhaä & Meester, 2005), along with its exercise solutions. This resource is valuable for both beginners and those revisiting the fundamentals. The annotations (highlights and notes) were made by Dr. Cristian Spitoni, who used this textbook as the primary material to teach in a course I took during my bachelor’s study.
