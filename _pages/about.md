I am generally interested in scientific research, while my career thus far focused in the field of computational biology/biochemistry, I am also eager to apply my skill set for problem solving within other natural sciences. My life-long secular pilgrimage is to pursue the nature of reality through unceasing study of philosophy, mathematics, and physical sciences.

Currently
------

2021-2025

I am a PhD student at the [Physical Chemistry Curie Lab](https://institut-curie.org/unit/umr168), an interdiscipinary research unit of [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/) that uses physics to understand living matter. While [my team](https://institut-curie.org/team/levy) specialises in molecular microscopy of membranes by means of in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, [my project](https://copper-antoinette-68.tiiny.site) is focused on the development and application of image processing workflows for characterising membrane morphologies and resolving membrane protein structures from cryo-electron tomography data. 

Previously

2018-2021

Before I started my PhD, I was a master student at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), where I focused my coursework in bioinformatics and computational biology. Through research internships, I gained experience in the fields of microfluidics (synthetic biology), proteomics (cancer biology), single-cell RNA sequencing (evolution), molecular dynamics (biochemical physics), and image processing for cryo-electron tomography (virology).

2015-2018

I completed my bachelor study at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), an honours college of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where I focused on the following subjects (tracks) ranked by course weight from high to low: cognitive neuroscience, chemistry, molecular cell biology, & medicine (gained pre-med qualification). Some topics of my track-finishing projects: spatial perception, brain imaging with fMRI/MRI, drug design, and plant molecular biology. Topics of my research internships: therapeutic nanoparticles, development and cancer modelling in organoids.

Future
------

2025-?

I intend to pursue a postdoctoral position and eventually a professorship in fundamental scientific research after my PhD graduation. I am interested in continuing in the field of cryo-electron microscopy/tomography. I am also keen on exploring alternative computational projects in protein sciences (e.g., protein structure, function, and interaction simulation/prediction, and protein design), abiogenesis, molecular paleontology/evolution, and image/signal processing (for applications in neuroscience, geoscience, astronomy and/or others). I am not actively seeking industrial positions, but I would be glad to be a part of promising academic startups and companies that make positive environmental impacts.

Hobbies
------

As a child, I practised gymnastics, learnt to play the piano, won awards in art and creative writing competitions. I also published writing pieces and obtained an official line art skill qualification. As a teen, my interests completely shifted to sciences. Instead, I won awards in Olympiad maths, innovative physics, and academic debate competitions. 

Nowadays, since my work happens to be my major hobby, I am taking it easy. I enjoy going around on my goofy kickscooter, taking care of my pet lizard and his live food, struggling to play the majestic [otamatone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I7nCZVky40) well (one day), doing [amateur landscape photography](https://www.instagram.com/cyansingjikching/?hl=en) when I travel and/or hike, going urban exploring (I am open to information sharing), bouldering, and playing [DnD or games alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) with friends, I dungeon master.
