Founder of the [Liberal Academics Society](https://www.facebook.com/lasutrecht?locale=de_DE) in 2016 at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/organisatie/university-college-utrecht), the honours college of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/). With two generations of board members, we organised public interactive lecture sessions for undergraduate students to share their academic as well as non-academic knowledge, ideas, and skills. E.g., quantum mechanics: fiction versus reality, misconceptions about crocodiles, convert mental health struggles into growth, songwriting from the heart with the help of a loop panel, etc.
