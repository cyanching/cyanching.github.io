title: "Molecular mechanisms of stress-induced
reactivation in mumps virus condensates"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-04-27-paper-2
excerpt: 'Negative-stranded RNA viruses can establish long-term persistent infection in the form of large intracellular
inclusions in the human host and cause chronic diseases. Here, we uncover how cellular stress disrupts the
metastable host-virus equilibrium in persistent infection and induces viral replication in a culture model of
mumps virus. Using a combination of cell biology, whole-cell proteomics, and cryo-electron tomography,
we show that persistent viral replication factories are dynamic condensates and identify the largely disordered viral phosphoprotein as a driver of their assembly. Upon stress, increased phosphorylation of the
phosphoprotein at its interaction interface with the viral polymerase coincides with the formation of a stable
replication complex. By obtaining atomic models for the authentic mumps virus nucleocapsid, we elucidate a
concomitant conformational change that exposes the viral genome to its replication machinery. These events
constitute a stress-mediated switch within viral condensates that provide an environment to support upregulation of viral replication.'
